/*
 * Nathan Leach (October 2017)
 * 
 * This is a simple concurrency/multi-threading example.
 * 
 * Run OutlineViewer in server mode on your machine before starting this program:
 * 
 * java -jar OutlineViewer.jar
 * 
 *
 * This connects to the NetworkTables server (OutlineViewer in this case) and registers a
 * boolean variable "ResetCounter" with the default value of false.  The program then
 * prints out an incrementing number in the console.  If the value of ResetCounter is
 * set to "true" in the OutlineViewer, the program should immediately start counting
 * starting from 0 again amd the value in the OutlineViewer should be reset back to false.
 *
 *
 * In the previous program, the AtomicInteger was introduced as a means of allowing
 * multiple threads of execution control the value of a counter.  As with anything
 * programming related, there are multiple ways to do the same thing.  
 * 
 * In this example, we introduce a set of synchronized methods. The "synchronized"
 * keyword means that only one thread may execute the method at a time.  It is
 * therefore possible to still use the primitive integer type to represent the counter.
 * However, it is not possible to use the primitive integer type alone.
 * 
 * What is the difference between this method and the use of the AtomicInteger?
 *
